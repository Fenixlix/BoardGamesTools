An easy to use app for helping with the process of playing board games with friends.
For the moment it counts with tools for Triomino, and a virtual Craps game. 

* The UI was made using **The Views system with xml files**
* For the data management I use the **Room library**
* It implements the **MVVM** architecture 
* Also uses **Dagger Hilt** for a better scalability
